# Contributing

## AI use

This code was written largely with AI assistance under human direction. The same is true
of the harnesses, the reports under `docs/reports/` and these documents. The reports are
written in the first person by the session that did the work; "I ran" in a report means
that session ran it.

What makes that workable is the testing method. Every change is judged by comparing ra-jit's
output with rustc's on real programs, and a change that makes a harness differ does not
land. If you contribute with AI assistance, the expectation is the same as without: you
understand the change, you ran the gate, and you say what you ran and what you did not.

rust-analyzer has its own AI policy for contributions to rust-analyzer. It applies to what
you send them, including fixes you find here and want to upstream.

`crates/hir-ty-codegen` is not a crate. It is the module `hir_ty::mir::codegen`, which uses
private items of `hir-ty`. It is kept outside the submodule because all of it is ra-jit's:
`mir.rs` in the submodule declares the module with a `#[path]` that points back here. So
the submodule builds only as part of this repository.

## rust-analyzer

`vendor/rust-analyzer` is a submodule of this same repository, on its `rust-analyzer`
branch. That branch is upstream rust-analyzer at the commit ra-jit forked from
(`dd5ed69d4b`) with ra-jit's changes committed on top: about 160 files in 24 crates. `main`
records which commit of that branch it builds with, as git does for any submodule.

After cloning:

    git clone --recursive https://github.com/DioxusLabs/rustd
    cargo +1.99.0 build -p ra-jit --release

or `git submodule update --init` in a clone made without `--recursive`. There is nothing
else to run. After a pull that moves the submodule, `git submodule update` again.

### Changing a rust-analyzer file

Edit the file in `vendor/rust-analyzer`, build and test from the root as usual. Then
commit in two places:

    cd vendor/rust-analyzer
    git switch rust-analyzer      # once; a fresh submodule is on a detached commit
    git commit -am "..."
    git push origin rust-analyzer
    cd ../..
    git add vendor/rust-analyzer  # main now builds with the new commit
    git commit

Push the submodule before `main`, or `main` names a commit nobody else can fetch. The
`rust-analyzer` branch only moves forward; do not rebase or force-push it, because old
commits of `main` name commits on it.

A change to rust-analyzer should be something rust-analyzer could take: a bug fix in MIR
lowering or inference, a missing piece of the language, an accessor ra-jit needs. Code that
is only ra-jit's belongs in `crates/hir-ty-codegen` or `crates/ra-jit`, where a change is one
ordinary commit. Fixes that are simply rust-analyzer bugs should be sent upstream, under
their rules.

### Moving to a newer rust-analyzer

1. In `vendor/rust-analyzer`, merge the new upstream commit into the `rust-analyzer`
   branch and resolve conflicts. Merge, not rebase, so the branch keeps moving forward.
2. Update `Cargo.toml` and `Cargo.lock` at the root for dependencies rust-analyzer changed.
3. Build, and run the whole gate under both backends ([harness.md](harness.md)). A newer
   rust-analyzer changes inference, MIR lowering and layout queries, any of which can
   change generated code. The corpus with `--layouts`, `breakers.py` and
   `fuzz/fuzz.py smoke` are the ones that notice first.
4. Push the branch, then commit the new submodule commit on `main`.

Nobody has done this yet, so this procedure is the intended one and has not been
exercised.

### Where the history is

`main` began as a tree generated from a development branch that was rust-analyzer's tree
with ra-jit's changes made in place. That branch and its history are kept as
`ra-jit-collate` and `ra-jit-spike`. `publish/split.py` there is what wrote this layout.

The toolchain is a separate pin. ra-jit is built for Rust 1.99.0 and `vendor/rustc_abi` is
rustc's crate from that tag. Moving to another Rust version means taking the new
`rustc_abi`, rechecking everything that mirrors rustc (the Rust ABI in the code generator,
`vtable.rs`, `type_id.rs`, symbol names in `symbols.rs`), and running rustc's own test
suites through `uitest.py` and `libsuite.py` again.

## Rules for code

1. **rustc is the reference.** If ra-jit's program behaves differently from rustc's, ra-jit
   is wrong, even where rustc's behaviour looks like an accident.
2. **Never guess.** Input the code generator has no explicit lowering for is refused with a
   reason (`CodegenError`), not lowered on a best-effort basis. A refusal is visible and
   counted. A wrong guess is a miscompile nobody sees.
3. **A refused function is a bug**, to be listed and fixed, not a normal path to design
   around.
4. **General fixes.** A fix that tests for one crate, one function name or one test is not
   a fix. Find what the case is an instance of.

Style follows rust-analyzer's guide
(`vendor/rust-analyzer/docs/book/src/contributing/style.md`): `cargo fmt`, no new
dependencies without a reason, small focused changes. Comments say what the code is for and
why, not what was changed. Messages printed to the user say what happened and what ra-jit
did about it in one line.

## What a change needs

- A reduced case that fails before and passes after: a corpus function for a code
  generator feature, a breaker for a bug found in real code, a step in the relevant edit
  harness for a daemon bug. [harness.md](harness.md) says how to add each.
- The gate, under Cranelift and under LLVM, on the platform you have. Say which platforms
  you did not run. CI covers Linux x86-64, Linux AArch64, Windows and macOS.
- `cargo fmt --all -- --check` and
  `cargo test --release -p hir-ty -p hir-def -p parser -p syntax -p ra-jit`.
- For anything that changes numbers in [results.md](results.md): the command, the commit
  and the machine, so the entry can be replaced and not just appended to.

When you report what you did, separate what you ran from what you inferred. The reports
under `docs/reports/` do this and it is the reason they can be used.
